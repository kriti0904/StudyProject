	StudentSuvidha is a community for students where all students in the
	same fields can commute with each other and they can help their mates.
	We help them by providing notes and previous year question papers. So
	that they donâ€™t have to waste their precious time in searching for
	these notes and can put their maximum efforts towards their studies.

	PassHoJao is a platform for students to create and consume content
	relevant to them. Volunteer to provide support and help expand the
